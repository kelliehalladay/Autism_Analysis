# Autism_Analysis

This project was created with the goal of bridging the gap between autistic and non-autistic communication.  I have created a model to predict the way autistic and non-autistic people would respond to a question/prompt.  This was done by scraping text data from www.reddit.com - more specifically, subreddits /r/autism, /r/AutismInWomen, and /r/Autism_Parenting.
